/// precision. Difficulty and target have an inverse relationship:
/// ```text
/// target = MAX_TARGET / difficulty
/// difficulty = MAX_TARGET / target
/// ```
///
/// Used for:
/// - Stratum protocol (pools communicate difficulty as integers)
/// - Logging and display (human-readable values)
/// - Share validation (via `to_target()`)
/// - Forced low-difficulty testing (sub-1.0 values)
///
/// In Bitcoin's proof-of-work, a hash is valid if it's numerically less than
/// or equal to a target value:
/// - Difficulty 1: target = MAX_TARGET (largest valid target, easiest)
/// - Difficulty 1000: target = MAX_TARGET / 1000 (smaller target, harder)
/// - Difficulty 0.001: target = MAX_TARGET * 1000 (larger than MAX, very easy)
///
/// Higher difficulty produces a smaller target, meaning fewer hash values
/// qualify as valid, requiring more hashing attempts on average.
